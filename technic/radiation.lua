Radioactivity

Radiation resistance represents the extent to which a material
attenuates radiation passing through it; i.e., how good a radiation
shield it is.  This is identified per node type.  For materials that
exist in real life, the radiation resistance value that this system
uses for a node type consisting of a solid cube of that material is the
(approximate) number of halvings of ionising radiation that is achieved
by a meter of the material in real life.  This is approximately
proportional to density, which provides a good way to estimate it.
Homogeneous mixtures of materials have radiation resistance computed
by a simple weighted mean.  Note that the amount of attenuation that
a material achieves in-game is not required to be (and is not) the
same as the attenuation achieved in real life.

Radiation resistance for a node type may be specified in the node
definition, under the key "radiation_resistance".  As an interim
measure, until node definitions widely include this, this code
knows a bunch of values for particular node types in several mods,
and values for groups of node types.  The node definition takes
precedence if it specifies a value.  Nodes for which no value at
all is known are taken to provide no radiation resistance at all;
this is appropriate for the majority of node types.  Only node types
consisting of a fairly homogeneous mass of material should report
non-zero radiation resistance; anything with non-uniform geometry
or complex internal structure should show no radiation resistance.
Fractional resistance values are permitted.

Radioactive nodes cause damage to nearby players.  The damage
effect depends on the intrinsic strength of the radiation source,
the distance between the source and the player, and the shielding
effect of the intervening material.  These determine a rate of damage;
total damage caused is the integral of this over time.

In the absence of effective shielding, for a specific source the
damage rate varies realistically in inverse proportion to the square
of the distance.  (Distance is measured to the player's abdomen,
not to the nominal player position which corresponds to the foot.)
However, if the player is inside a non-walkable (liquid or gaseous)
radioactive node, the nominal distance could go to zero, yielding
infinite damage.  In that case, the player's body is displacing the
radioactive material, so the effective distance should remain non-zero.
We therefore apply a lower distance bound of sqrt(0.75), which is
the maximum distance one can get from the node center within the node.

A radioactive node is identified by being in the "radioactive" group,
and the group value signifies the strength of the radiation source.
The group value is the distance from a node at which an unshielded
player will be damaged by 1 HP/s.  Or, equivalently, it is the square
root of the damage rate in HP/s that an unshielded player one node
away will take.

Shielding is assessed by adding the shielding values of all nodes
between the source node and the player, ignoring the source node itself.
As in reality, shielding causes exponential attenuation of radiation.
However, the effect is scaled down relative to real life.  A node with
radiation resistance value R yields attenuation of sqrt(R) * 0.1 nepers.
(In real life it would be about R * 0.69 nepers, by the definition
of the radiation resistance values.)  The sqrt part of this formula
scales down the differences between shielding types, reflecting the
game's simplification of making expensive materials such as gold
readily available in cubes.  The multiplicative factor in the
formula scales down the difference between shielded and unshielded
safe distances, avoiding the latter becoming impractically large.

Damage is processed at rates down to 0.2 HP/s, which in the absence of
shielding is attained at the distance specified by the "radioactive"
group value.  Computed damage rates below 0.2 HP/s result in no
damage at all to the player.  This gives the player an opportunity
to be safe, and limits the range at which source/player interactions
need to be considered.
