# technic API

This file documents the functions within the technic modpack for use in mods.


## Tiers
Tier are network types. List of pre-registered tiers:

* `"LV"`, Low Voltage
* `"MV"`, Medium Voltage
* `"HV"`, High Voltage

Available functions:

* `technic.register_tier(tier, description)`
	* Registers a network type (tier)
	* `tier`: string, short name (ex. `LV`)
	* `description`: string, long name (ex. `Low Voltage`)
	* See also `tiers`


## Cables
* `technic.register_cable(tier, size)`
	* Registers an existing node as cable
	* `tier`: string
	* `size`: number, visual size of the wire
* `technic.get_cable_tier(nodename)`
	* Retrieves the tier assigned to the provided node name
	* `nodename`: string, name of the node
	* Returns the tier (string) or `nil`
* `technic.is_tier_cable(nodename, tier)`
	* Tells whether the node `nodename` is the cable of the tier `tier`.
	* Short version of `technic.get_cable_tier(nodename) == tier`


## Machines
The machine type indicates the direction of power flow.
List of pre-registered machine types:

* `technic.receiver = "RE"` e.g. grinder
* `technic.producer = "PR"` e.g. solar panel
* `technic.producer_receiver = "PR_RE"` supply converter
* `technic.battery  = "BA"` e.g. LV battery box

Available functions:

* `technic.register_machine(tier, nodename, machine_type)`
	* Register an existing node as machine, bound to the network tier
	* `tier`: see `register_tier`
	* `nodename`: string, node name
	* `machine_type`: string, following options are possible:
		* `"RE"`: Receiver
		* `"PR"`: Producer
		* `"BA"`: Battery, energy storage
	* See also `Machine types`

Functions to use for callbacks:

* `technic.can_insert_unique_stack(pos, node, stack, direction)`
* `technic.insert_object_unique_stack(pos, node, stack, direction)`
	* Functions for the parameters `can_insert` and `insert_object` to avoid
	  filling multiple inventory slots with same type of item.

### Specific machines
* `technic.register_solar_array(data)`
	* data is a table (TODO)


## Tools
* `technic.register_power_tool(itemname, max_charge)`
	* Register or configure the maximal charge held by an existing item
	* `craftitem`: string, item or node name
	* `max_charge`: number, maximal EU capacity


## Helper functions
Unsorted functions:

* `technic.EU_string(num)`
	* Converts num to a human-readable string (see `pretty_num`)
	  and adds the `EU` unit
	* Use this function when showing players energy values
* `technic.pretty_num(num)`
	* Converts the number `num` to a human-readable string with SI prefixes
* `technic.config:get(name)`
	* Some configuration function
* `technic.tube_inject_item(pos, start_pos, velocity, item)`
	* Same as `pipeworks.tube_inject_item`

### Energy modifiers
* `technic.set_RE_wear(itemstack, item_load, max_charge)`
	* Modifies the power tool wear of the given itemstack
	* `itemstack`: ItemStack to modify
	* `item_load`: number, used energy in EU
	* `max_charge`: number, maximal EU capacity of the tool
	* The itemdef field `wear_represents` must be set to `"technic_RE_charge"`,
	  otherwise this function will do nothing.
	* Returns the modified itemstack
* `technic.refill_RE_charge(itemstack)`
	* This function fully recharges an RE chargeable item.
	* If `technic.power_tools[itemstack:get_name()]` is `nil` (or `false`), this
	  function does nothing, else that value is the maximum charge.
	* The itemstack metadata is changed to contain the charge.

### Node-specific
* `technic.get_or_load_node(pos)`
	* If the mapblock is loaded, it returns the node at pos,
	  else it loads the chunk and returns `nil`.
* `technic.swap_node(pos, nodename)`
	* Same as `mintest.swap_node` but it only changes the nodename.
	* It uses `minetest.get_node` before swapping to ensure the new nodename
	  is not the same as the current one.
* `technic.trace_node_ray(pos, dir, range)`
	* Returns an iteration function (usable in the for loop) to iterate over the
	  node positions along the specified ray.
	* The returned positions will not include the starting position `pos`.
* `technic.trace_node_ray_fat(pos, dir, range)`
	* Like `technic.trace_node_ray` but includes extra positions near the ray.
	* The node ray functions are used for mining lasers.


## Item Definition fields
Groups:

* `technic_<tier> = 1`
	* Makes the node connect to the cables of the matching tier name
	* `<tier>`: name of the tier, in lowercase (ex. `lv`)
* `technic_machine = 1`
	* UNRELIABLE. Indicates whether the item or node belongs to technic
* `connect_sides = {"top", "left", ...}`
	* Extends the Minetest API. Indicates where the machine can be connected.

Additional definition fields:

* `wear_represents = "string"`
	* Specifies how the tool wear level is handled. Available modes:
		* `"mechanical_wear"`: represents physical damage
		* `"technic_RE_charge"`: represents electrical charge
* `<itemdef>.technic_run = function(pos, node) ...`
	* This callback is used to update the node.
	  Modders have to manually change the information about supply etc. in the
	  node metadata.
* `<itemdef>.technic_disabled_machine_name = "string"`
	* Specifies the machine's node name to use when it's not connected connected to a network
* `<itemdef>.technic_on_disable = function(pos, node) ...`
	* This callback is run when the machine is no longer connected to a technic-powered network.


## Node Metadata fields
Nodes connected to the network will have one or more of these parameters as meta
data:

* `<tier>_EU_supply` - direction: output
	* For nodes registered as `PR` or `BA` tier
	* This is the EU value supplied by the node.
* `<tier>_EU_demand` - direction: output
	* For nodes registered as `RE` or `BA` tier
	* This is the EU value the node requires to run.
* `<tier>_EU_input` - direction: input
	* For nodes registered as `RE` or `BA` tier
	* This is the actual EU value the network can give the node.

`<tier>` corresponds to the tier name registered using
`technic.register_tier` (ex. `LV`). It is possible for the machine to depend on
multiple tiers (or networks).


## Switching Station mechanics
The switching station is the center of all power distribution on an electric
network.

The station collects power from sources (PR), distributes it to sinks (RE),
and uses the excess/shortfall to charge and discharge batteries (BA).

For now, all supply and demand values are expressed in kW.

It works like this:
 All PR,BA,RE nodes are indexed and tagged with the switching station.
The tagging is a workaround to allow more stations to be built without allowing
a cheat with duplicating power.
 All the RE nodes are queried for their current EU demand. Those which are off
would require no or a small standby EU demand, while those which are on would
require more.
If the total demand is less than the available power they are all updated with
the demand number.
If any surplus exists from the PR nodes the batteries will be charged evenly
with this.
If the total demand requires draw on the batteries they will be discharged
evenly.

If the total demand is more than the available power all RE nodes will be shut
down. We have a brown-out situation.

Hence for now all the power distribution logic resides in this single node.
